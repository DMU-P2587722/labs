    <p style="font-family: segoe ui light">It was revealed this morning that a major high street back has <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to preform basic data-entry tasks in several of its UK data centres.

Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and would also help brighten things up, adding a little cheer for those enjoying a temporary stay.</p>

<p style="font-family:segoe ui light">If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of carrying a bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window cleaning injuries a year could be avoided. They're also good company on a lunch break.</p>
